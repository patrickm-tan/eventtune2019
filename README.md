# Event Tune 

A event finding application that was initially designed for the University of Toronto. Event Tune helps simplifies the process of finding interesting events on the school campus and incorporates a badge system to motivate user behavior in the application. This is project is a complete design cycle, starting from - finding and creating a research question to usability testing of the high-fidelity prototype.

## About

In this repository, you will see each assignment that is a milestone for the project timeline. Each assignment was a building step in towards of making a successful design (in this case, mobile application). Alongside with my group members, we completed each assignment which varied in research, testing and design. The project was structured for the entirety of the semester which consist of 12 weeks (Give or take, snowday). You can view the PDF version of each report, which is provides the information of what was accomplished in that assignment.
