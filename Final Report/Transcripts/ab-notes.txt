p1:
confused about search icon

badges

p1:
A bit confused that badges could be clicked on
Once they got familiar with the process they went through it quick
Navigated back to the badges quickly and redeemed the awards.

q1: Likes the badges more than points, badges are a bit more clear and fun.
q2: Badges are self explanitory
q3: 100% feels like badges would increase event attendance and interaction (from an actually executive president of ICCIT COUNCIL)

p2:
bottom bar is not home button not intuitive
suggest that event page should redirect to search results (not the homepage)
students are probably still busy, the incentive (maybe lower the badge reward count)

p3:
when checking rewards doesnt look clickable
- add redeem to the actual voucher
"save" should be search

wouldn't mind using app to see whats going on. gameification makes the event finding process more enjoyable. Concerned about organizers not having enough

p4: 
kinda confused where to find ICCIT events
used the actual ICCITcouncil tag to search for
bar to shown as progress and when it reaches it should be clickable (button appears ,green)

p2:
Navigated to profile without an issue from the home screen.
Had issues finding the searching or filter function/icon on the screen.

q1: Thinks its pretty good, having a tangible reward system for events would be more incentive. 
q2: Seeing the reward previews and having tangible rewards would be good.
q3: Thinks that it would overall be beneficial, especiially if sponsors or outsources are engaged with the app. Having rewards for "checkpoints/milestones" would be interesting.
